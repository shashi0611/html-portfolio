<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>
  <li>This is my second favourite movie.</li>
  <li>
    This movie is about a legendary person who lead a very simple life. He is
    the man of focus and skills.
  </li>
  <li>
    This movie is totaly included with all types of guns and other weapons with
    lots of killings and blood shade.

<h3>Vampire Diaries</h3>
<p>
  This is my third favourite movie. <br />
  This movie is also about killings but in this they won't use any weapons
  mostly.But the killings happens by the beasts created by a mother,who wanted
  to protect her children by making them unkillable,but this leads to a eternity
  of blood shade.
